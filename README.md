# Channly

Channly is a web app that displays all relevant KPIs for Online Marketing. It is often, especially for small businesses, not easy to track every marketing channel in one program. Either you have to pay a lot of money or you need an API key which most times require a big budget.

With this tool, it is easy to see which channel performs best and how its daily performance is.
